## Case Management Made Simple

* Use the sidebar to [**switch between cases**](https://help.striae.org/striae-users-guide/case-management/striae-case-management), organize files, and keep track of important notes—everything stays neatly on one screen.

* Easily manage your profile and sign out whenever you need.

## Detailed Case View

* Upload images, select which ones to annotate, and review essential info like case numbers and image details—all in one place.

## Dynamic Image Annotation

* [**See and annotate comparison images**](https://help.striae.org/striae-users-guide/annotating-printing/striae-image-annotation-and-pdf-generation-guide) on an interactive canvas area, with a dynamic toolbar that makes annotating your images easy.

* Add notes, mark support levels, and record findings. Rest easy knowing every annotation is **securely saved and instantly updated**.

## Authenticated Confirmations System

Reviewing examiners may [**digitally confirm comparison images**](https://help.striae.org/striae-users-guide/authenticated-confirmations/authenticated-confirmations), with confirmations secured by:

* User authentication (ensuring only authorized users may confirm)

* Data file cryptographic hash validation (to ensure case package integrity)

* Timestamp validation (prevents confirmation of outdated or modified files)

* Self-confirmation blocking (users cannot confirm their own work)

These controls ensure every confirmation is credible, verified, and audit-ready.

## Effortless PDF Reports

[**Create detailed, timestamped PDF reports with one click**](https://help.striae.org/striae-users-guide/annotating-printing/striae-image-annotation-and-pdf-generation-guide#pdf-generation).
