          <h2 id="storage">Data Storage Addendum</h2>
<p>At Striae, We take Your privacy and Data security seriously. We understand the sensitive nature of the Data that You may store with Us. This Data Storage Addendum outlines how We handle and store Your Data within the app.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p><strong>Authentication and Password Security</strong></p>
<p>Striae relies on Firebase Authentication, a highly secure and trusted platform, developed by Google, to handle user authentication. Key features of Firebase Authentication include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Hashed Authentication Data</strong></p>
  <p>Firebase secures passwords and authentication details using industry-standard hashing algorithms. This ensures that Your credentials are stored in a secure, unreadable format.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Advanced Threat Detection</strong></p>
  <p>Firebase employs machine learning models to detect and mitigate suspicious activity, such as brute-force attacks or unauthorized login attempts.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication</strong></p>
  <p>Firebase supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), providing an additional layer of security for Your account.</p></li>  
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Storage: Secure and Private</strong></p>
<p>Your Data is secured in off-site storage, using industry-standard security protocols to ensure it is protected from unauthorized access and physical theft. We prioritize Your privacy and make sure Your information is kept private and confidential. A few of the measures in place include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No Exposed Plain Text</strong></p>
    <p>User profile information and all Data stored by Striae are encrypted and never stored in exposed plain text. Instead, all sensitive information is stored securely behind undecipherable unique identifiers, further isolating Your Data from potential breaches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Segregation/Isolation</strong></p>
    <p>Striae utilizes separate and distinct systems to store Your Data. This segregation enhances security by limiting access points and isolating sensitive information from unrelated systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AES-256 Encryption</strong></p>
    <p>Striae uses AES-256 encryption to safeguard Your Data at rest. This encryption standard is one of the most secure methods available, ensuring that even if Data storage is breached, the information remains unreadable and protected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What is AES-256?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</strong> is a symmetric encryption algorithm that has been extensively tested and proven to provide a high level of security.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>256-bit Encryption</strong> refers to the length of the encryption key. The longer the key, the more secure the encryption, as it increases the complexity of potential decryption attempts exponentially.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Used by the U.S. Government:</strong> AES-256 has been adopted as the encryption standard by the U.S. government for securing classified information. Specifically, it is approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and used to protect sensitive information.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Why AES-256 is Secure</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Key Size:</strong> A 256-bit key length means there are 2^256 possible key combinations, making it virtually impossible to break using current computing capabilities.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Resistance to Brute Force:</strong> Even with advanced computational power, it would take billions of years to attempt all possible key combinations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Global Trust:</strong> AES-256 is trusted worldwide by governments, financial institutions, and security-focused organizations for its unparalleled ability to secure data.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li><p><strong>Transport Layer Security</strong></p>
  <p>All Data transfers are encrypted using TLS, ensuring protection from interception or tampering while in transit.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Signed URLs</strong></p>
  <p>Using HMAC-SHA-256, temporary signed URLs provide authenticated, tamper-evident, time-limited access to your images and files.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong></p>
  <p>Access requests and Data transfers are logged in detail, allowing Us to audit activities and identify any unauthorized access attempts.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support</strong></p>
  <p>To prevent unauthorized access, Striae restricts Data requests to its domain exclusively.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Security Policy</strong></p>
  <p>The open security policy encourages users and researchers to safely and responsibly report vulnerabilities. This collaborative approach ensures the security measures remain robust and up-to-date. Please refer to Our <Link to="/security">Security Policy</Link> for more information.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access to Data</strong></p>
<p>Your Data is strictly accessible only by You, the user, and by Striae as necessary. Striae may access Your Data only for troubleshooting, maintenance, or support purposes, and only to the extent required to resolve issues or provide assistance. No unauthorized third party has access to Your Data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Sharing of Sensitive Information</strong></p>
<p>Striae does not collect or share sensitive information, such as images, case numbers, item numbers, or any other personally identifiable information with third parties. Additionally, Your Data is not subject to analysis, scraping, or processing by third-party analytics tools, AI systems, or any other automated processes outside the scope of the app’s intended use. The integrity and confidentiality of Your Data are paramount to Us.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p><strong>Data Control</strong></p>
  <p>Striae will never edit or modify the contents of Your Data without Your explicit input. The only edits made to Your Data will be for the purpose of resizing and compression for optimal display, storage, and performance. When You delete Data it is permanently removed from our systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account Deletion</strong></p>
<p>If You choose to delete Your account, all associated Data and information will be permanently and completely removed from Striae. Once deleted, Your Data cannot be recovered by You or any third party.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Striae’s security measures are designed to keep Your Data secure, private, and under Your control. Should You have any questions, concerns, or feedback about these security protocols, We encourage You to reach out to Us. </p>
