      <h2>Introducing Striae – A New Tool for Firearms Examiners</h2>
      <p>
        We are excited to announce Striae, an innovative web app designed to assist firearms examiners in creating detailed annotations for your comparison images. Striae aims to streamline the processes of labeling, note-taking, and printing, making the review process a little bit easier. <strong><Link to="https://help.striae.org/striae-users-guide/getting-started/where-does-striae-fit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where does Striae fit into your workflow?</Link></strong>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Features of Striae</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Annotation Tools:</strong> Simplify the process of marking and labeling comparison images with ease. Add case and item number labels, labels for class characteristics, a potential subclass warning/indicator, an indexing color/number indicator, support indicator for ID, inconclusive, or exclusion, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Streamlined Note-Taking:</strong> Keep comprehensive and organized notes directly linked to your comparison images. Add or modify your notes at any time, and easily print them or save as a PDF for your casefile.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Case Export/Import:</strong> Seamlessly transfer cases between systems or share with colleagues through secure ZIP export functionality. Export complete cases with images, annotations, and metadata for archival or collaboration, and import cases for review with full data integrity validation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Case Review and Authenticated Confirmations:</strong> Enable secure peer review and confirmation workflows with authenticated access to read-only case data. Technical reviewers can examine findings and provide confirmations while maintaining complete audit trails for quality assurance and laboratory standards.
        </li>        
        <li>
            <strong>Convert to PDF to Save or Print: </strong> Generate professional-quality PDF outputs for documentation and reporting. Include authenticated digital confirmation records or traditional confirmation remarks in your final reports for comprehensive case documentation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Security Features of Striae</strong></p>
      <p>
        Coming from a forensics background ourselves, we understand the necessity for strong security measures in order to protect your data and files. From day one, Striae was designed with data security as a top priority.
        <p>
            We have implemented the following security features in Striae:
        </p>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Authentication and Password Security:</strong> Striae relies on Firebase Authentication, a secure platform by Google, to manage user authentication. Features of Firebase include hashed passwords, secure token generation, and multi-factor authentication options.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Storage:</strong> Your data is encrypted and protected against unauthorized access. Measures include data segregation, AES-256 encryption with GCM mode via Cloudflare R2 and KV storage¹, and no plaintext storage of sensitive information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Transit:</strong> All data transfers are encrypted via TLS, and access is controlled through the use of signed URLs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Comprehensive Audit Trail:</strong> Striae maintains a detailed audit trail of all user and case-related activities, providing transparency and accountability. This includes logging user actions, data modifications, and system events to ensure a secure and traceable environment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Controlled Access and Monitoring:</strong> Access requests are logged for auditing and security. Data access is limited to you or authorized troubleshooting only. CORS support restricts data requests to Striae&apos;s domain exclusively.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> We maintain an open security policy, which encourages reporting of vulnerabilities and issues. We are committed to addressing any security concerns promptly and transparently. Striae does not share sensitive data with third parties, nor is any data stored with Striae subject to scraping, analysis, or processing for any purpose other than the intended use of the app. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Control Over Your Data:</strong> Striae will never edit or modify the contents of your data. The only edits made to your data will be resizing and compression for optimal display, storage, and performance. When you delete your data, it is permanently removed from our systems.
        </li>        
      </ul>
